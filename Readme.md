### Code in short
        Run MATLAB as administrator.

        Add the saved installation files to the MATLAB path.

        You can do this by entering addpath('foldername') at the MATLAB command prompt. Replace foldername with the name of the folder in which you saved the installation files—e.g., C:\Temp.

        At the MATLAB command prompt, enter install_addon('zipname').

        Replace zipname with the name of the zip archive—e.g., smlink.r2015b.win64.zip.

        In a MATLAB session running in administrator mode — At the command prompt, enter regmatlabserver.

        DONT forget smlink_linksw (later in documentation)
